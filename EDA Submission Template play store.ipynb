For this project, two CSV files were provided as datasets. The first one had 13 columns with information about applications, named 'Play Store data,' and the second file consisted of 5 columns with information regarding user experience with the applications, named 'User reviews.' The reason for choosing the Play Store data analysis project was that I have been using Play Store for many years to download applications, so it was easier for me to understand the provided data, and because of that understanding, it became easier to analyze and use my own new ideas.\n","\n","After selecting the topic, I started by importing libraries and connecting CSV files with Google Colab. I looked at the dataset and began analyzing the idea of what kind of project I wanted to make. The main question was, \"What will be the best or most crucial insight or objective I can provide from this project that a client can get?\" After many rejected and acceptable ideas, I came up with the motive that after looking at my project, a client should have a very clear idea of which category to choose for their applications in the market. And so began the journey of questions and coding.\n","\n","After selecting the motto of the project, I started forming questions that I found important to answer when a client is looking to select a category for their application. According to those questions, this project will provide the answers in the form of graphical representation. For the coding part, in the beginning, it was a little confusing and hard to play with data and refine it through coding, which was one of my biggest challenges during this project. Converting raw data in the dataset into a more usable form, for example: it took a lot of time for me to figure out the solution for how to convert the column 'Installs' into an integer data type by removing ',' and '+', and which logic and functions to use to get the solution. But after getting a little used to how Python works, it became somewhat interesting. By interesting, I mean that creating and plotting various kinds of plots was a very interesting part of this project for me. Slowly, I started to put in more ideas to make it look more and more appealing according to my knowledge, like selecting variable names for plots based on which chart I was working on or making graphs look more aesthetic rather than plain ones.\n","\n","And thus, with my knowledge and skill set, I made this project."],"metadata":{"id":"F6v_1wHtG2nS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **GitHub Link -**"],"metadata":{"id":"w6K7xa23Elo4"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Provide your GitHub Link here."],"metadata":{"id":"h1o69JH3Eqqn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Problem Statement**\n"],"metadata":{"id":"yQaldy8SH6Dl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**The Play Store apps data has enormous potential to drive app-making businesses to success.
